## Commit: 06_Gameplay_Tweaks - Refining Player Movement

This commit is all about "game feel." The player could move and jump before, but this update makes that movement feel smoother, more responsive, and more like a professional platformer game. This is achieved by adjusting physics variables and adding **air control**.

### Code Changes

The changes focus on the player's `Create` and `Step` events.

#### `Create_0.gml` (New Physics Variables)

Several variables were tweaked or added to fine-tune the player's movement.

```gml
walk_speed = 2.5;
jump_speed = -4;
air_accel = 0.5;
air_max = walk_speed;
```

*   `walk_speed` and `jump_speed` were slightly reduced. This is a common part of game development called "balancing"â€”tweaking numbers until the movement feels just right.
*   `air_accel = 0.5`: This is the **air acceleration**. It controls how quickly the player can change direction while in mid-air.
*   `air_max = walk_speed`: This sets a speed limit for how fast the player can move horizontally while in the air, preventing them from gaining infinite speed.

#### `Step_0.gml` (Implementing Air Control)

The biggest change is in how horizontal speed (`hsp`) is calculated.

**Old Code:**
```gml
hsp = walk_speed * dir;
```
This line meant the player had instant, full-speed movement, which can feel a bit robotic, especially in the air.

**New Code:**
```gml
if (on_ground) {
    hsp = walk_speed * dir; // Normal grounded movement
} else {
    // In air: preserve momentum, but allow some control
    hsp += dir * air_accel;
    hsp = clamp(hsp, -air_max, air_max);
}
```

This new logic creates a major difference in game feel:
*   **On the Ground**: Movement is still instant and responsive.
*   **In the Air**: This is the key change.
    *   `hsp += dir * air_accel;`: Instead of instantly setting the speed, the code now *adds* a small amount of speed in the direction the player is pressing. This creates a feeling of momentum and weight.
    *   `hsp = clamp(hsp, -air_max, air_max);`: This line uses the `clamp` function to make sure the horizontal speed in the air never goes above the `air_max` limit we set earlier.

A small tweak was also made to the variable jump height to feel better with the new gravity:
```gml
// Old line: vsp -= 0.5;
vsp -= 0.4; // New line: extra upward force
```

### Summary for Beginners

This commit makes the player's movement, especially in the air, feel much less stiff and more natural.
*   **Before**: When you jumped, you were locked into that jump's path. Changing direction in the air was instant and jerky.
*   **After**: Now, you have **air control**. You can gently influence your movement left and right while falling, allowing for more precise landings and a feeling of momentum. This is a subtle but hugely important feature for making a platformer fun to play.
